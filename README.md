```About me```  
I am a software developer with a background in e-commerce, fine art and photography. I assume positive intent in people, take a productive failure approach to problem solving. I started my second-hand clothing business with a goal to take responsibility and take pride in what I do. I decided to switch my career to do what I enjoyed most in the recent years. Software development allows me to be a part of a thriving environment and to work alongside a diverse team of inspiring individuals that share my goal of creating sustainable and pragmatic solutions that have a positive impact.
